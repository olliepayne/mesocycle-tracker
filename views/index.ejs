<h1>Mesocycle Tracker</h1>
<h2>What are Mesocycles?</h2>
<p>
  Mesocycles are a way to periodize athletic training. They're generally 2 weeks or longer, and they are a subset of a 'Macrocycle'. A Macrocycle is made up of all of your Mesocycles.<br>
  A Mesocycle will typically have a targeted attribute which the athlete is attempting to grow, for example: Strength, Hypertrophy, Power Endurance, etc...<br>
  Within a Mesocycle, one week of training is considered to be a 'Microcycle'. The overall hiearchy is Macrocycle -> Mesocycle -> Microcycle.<br>
  This concept of training periodzation was developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in an effort to edge Russia's atheletes ahead of the competition.<br>
  To this day, it is still an extremely viable form of training periodization.
